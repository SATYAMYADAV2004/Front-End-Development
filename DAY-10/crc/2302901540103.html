    </li>
    <P>
        <u>Ladhak</u>
        ministered by India <i>union territory</i> nd constitutes an eastern portion of the larger Kashmir region that
        has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947 and India and China since 1959.[2]
        Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the
        south, both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered
        Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass in the far north.
        It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the
        south.[12][13] The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed by the Indian
        Government as part of Ladakh, but has been under Chinese control. <a href="">Learn MORE</a>

    <H3>Importance of Ladhak</H3>
    <p>In the past, Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade
        routes,[18] but as Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the
        1960s, international trade dwindled. Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully encouraged tourism in
        Ladakh. As Ladakh is strategically important, the Indian military maintains a strong presence in the region.</p>
